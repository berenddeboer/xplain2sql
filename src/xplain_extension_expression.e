		"[
Extension expression. Extensions have two faces.
One face is during building extensions, that's done by the two
specializations of this class. This one is used when using the extension.
]"

	be_carefull: "[
		This class itself is used when a defined, completed
		extension is used in an expression (created in
		XPLAIN_EXTENSION.create_expression, called when building
		property expressions). Perhaps too cute a trick?
]"
