NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of xplain2sql
See ChangeLog for more details.

New or fixed in release 5.1 <2020-02-04>

* parameters:
- added the "-version" parameter.
* DDL:
- Using an enumeration that is too long is now an error.
* extend statement:
- the default for the min and max functions when there are now
  rows obeys the maximum and minimum of the domain restriction, if
  any.
* procedure:
- parameters do now take the optional keyword. The output has not
  changed, for example in PostgreSQL parameters can always be null,
  but this information is now made available in xplain2sql.xml.
* xplain2sql.xml:
- lots of additional detail in the output.
* Postgresql 9.5
- indexes are created with the "if not exists" clause.
- tables are now created with the  "if not exists" clause.
- option -iso8601date to force all dates to be emitted in ISO 8601
	format. This date format is compatible with what AppSync expects. No
	need to add custom SQL functions to output to get the right date,
	which also has the problem that the date type disappears and becomes
	a generic string. Now everything is still seen as a date, and
	returned properly.
- created function output time now has a better name if you used the
	advanced feature of calling a custom SQL function. For example:
	"select $`to_json'(created) from mytable" will now emit the nicer
	"created" field for this type instead of "to_json". Previously you
	had to use: "select $`to_json'(created) as created from mytable".


New or fixed in release 5.0 <2018-01-09>

* postgresql:
  - minimum value for a date was set to 0000-01-01, but that date is
 	  rejected with version 8.4. So minimum value is now 0001-01-01.
  - add support for Xplain's newdate function.
  - generated stored procedure was incorrect when it contained a get
    using division on an integer property: the generated type should
    have been a float, but was still an integer.
  - support for PostgreSQL 9.5:
    - support named parameters.
    - picture data type is now a bytea.
    - The real() function maps to the numeric data type with no specified limits on the before/after precision.
    - Procedure that returns a scalar value, return that as a value, no longer as a set. Will break existing code if you switch to using the 9.5. output.
* mysql:
  - extend with where claused caused a self select against a temporary
	  table which MySQL doesn't support.
  - it seems the dual table doesn't really behave like a table with a
   	single row. The output now generates a dual itself and uses that.
  - now drops views create for asserts, so running the script against
  	an existing database is easier.
  - now drops procedures before creating them, so running the script
  	against an existing database is easier.
  - proper support for some function as limit can be used in
	  subqueries as well.
* Microsoft SQL Server:
  - Add support for SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL
  - incorrect code for an existential extend.
* DB2:
  - incorrect code generated when updating an attribute from an extend.
* assert statement:
  - Assertion in SQL select was done with an inner join instead of a
    left outer join. Inner join is incorrect when the assertion is a
    some function as there might be no data.
* SQLite:
  - incorrect code generated when an expression instead ofconstant was used as default value for an attribute.
* purge statement:
  - Support purge of assertions.
* extend statement:
  - optimization: if extend not updated, generate optimized
  	output. Does wonders for MySQL 5. Also fixed bug where extra
  	temporary table step was inserted unnecessarily.
  - if extend is used outside a stored procedure, a view is created. Use
    option -noextendview to suppress this behaviour as we don't detect if you
    subsequently actually want to update that view.
  - extend with any/nil now emits a '1' instead of a column name in
	  the subselect. Works much better with MySQL's 'optimiser'.
  - with any/nil function code optimisation in case the extended
  	attribute is not update in a procedure.
  - logical expression code optimisation.
  - If an extend has an explicit representation, the resulting
    column is cast to that representation, instead of relying upon
  	what the particular SQL implementation decides the resulting type will be.
* Functions:
  - Didn't generate a proper column name for get max/get min.
  - Optimized output for any/nil: they're now done with a left outer
	  join, instead of a subselect. This gives a huge performance boost
	  under MySQL.
  - string(): when string() cast function was used in a string
   	concatenation, SQL output was incorrect.
* value statement:
  - inside stored procedure a value would not get proper type if it was
	  initialised by assigning a parameter.
  - When a value was purged, it was still listed as being in use, so
    when reusing it again or using it inside stored procedures it was
    not properly redeclared.
  - value statement didn't accept systemdate or loginname.
* procedures:
  - values could not freely use parameters in expressions.


New in release 4.0.1 <2008-08-19>

* License changed to MIT.
* SQL optimization: for the count, min, max and total functions
  xplain2sql now generates left outer joins instead of
  subselects. This leads to much better performing code in many
  circumstances.
* New extension to mimick SQL's insert into ... select.
* Extended attribute enhancements:
  - All attributes can now be updated using an extended attribute.
  - Extended attributes can now be updated with any value, not only
    other attributes, but also from other extended attributes.
  - It is now possible to define an extension with explicit
  	domain. Useful when representation cannot be calculated, for
  	example if you extend by calling a user defined SQL function.
  - Fixed long standing bug where after an extend column would have
    max 250 characters if a value statement had been used before
    it. Now it uses as many characters as required.
 -  wrong output for:
      extend t with e = (not (b1 or b2)).
    This was translated as if the user had written:
      extend t with e = (not b1 or b2).
* Assertion fixes and enhancements:
   - assert statement generated wrong code when its expression used
	   another asserted attribute.
   - assertion statement generated wrong code with a function
   	 expression.
* Update with where clause: wrong code generation when an or was used
  in the where condition.
* Value definition:
  - Didn't support the type cast functions like real.
  - Literal SQL expression wasn't allowed.
  - did not allow an and/or of twovalues such as (v1 or v2).
  - the expression inside an integer/datef/real/string cast could only
  	be a constant. But any expression should be allowed actually.
* Init statements:
    init t its b = (name = "boss").
* It's now possible to use if then else in a property list, such as:
    get t1 its if a1 then "yes" else "no".
* Combine function now takes two or more parameters.
* The parser now finds names as "week 1 date" a valid name. Names
	still have to start with a character, but numbers in names now
	accepted as well. Leads to less contrived names in some cases.
* .include and .use now handle absolute paths properly if they are
  unix style paths.
* SQL like operator wasn't always emitted when one would expect it.
* Domain (C2) emitted a varchar instead of char.
* Fixed crashes:
  - reading file from stdin
  - when extending a type twice with the same attribute name.
* FireBird (switch -firebord or -firebird21):
  - Support for FireBird 2.1
  - Support for FireBird's global temporary tables.
* MySQL 5:
  - support for using extended attributes in where clause of delete
  - return a value from within a stored procedure returned an ugly
  	column name, something as @"last_customer". Now the column name
  	looks better, but this change might break existing code.
  - Emits concat() function when combining strings.
* PostgreSQL:
  - PostgreSQL 8.2 support added. As PostgreSQL 8.1, but drop type is
    now conditional, so less error messages in the output.
  - -pgsql option defaults to 8.2.
  - PostgreSQL 8.1 support added.
  - *breaking change*: PostgreSQL doesn't really support identifiers
  	with spaces, for example if you have a sequential primary key
  	column with a space in it, PostgreSQL will generate an implicit
  	sequence which will have a name also with a space in it. But you
  	won't be able to access that sequence ever, PostgreSQL will give
  	the strange warning 'invalid name syntax'. So PostgreSQL no longer
  	emits spaces for names, they're always replaced by underscores,
  	until this issue gets fixed.
  - *possibly breaking change*: date type is now emitted as timestamp
  	with time zone.
  - if an Xplain function called a user procedure to return the value
  	of an attribute, xplain2sql would crash if that statement appeared
	  inside a procedure.
  - get max t its some_date emitted incorrect SQL when used inside a
    procedure.
  - fixed crash when get with a function used an expression to
   	calculate the total (total t its a * 2).
  - plsql code stored procedures is no longer emited in a quoted block
  	but it uses the $$ characters as delimiter.
  - can now create special procedure "trigger procedure" instead of
  	just "procedure" which generates output so the stored procedure can
	  be used as a trigger.
  - Emits proper string concatenator when combining strings.
* Microsoft SQL Server:
  - fix: complex update of an extension generated a left outer join in from
    clause instead of inner join.
  - fix: complex update fix, columns in set expression were not
  	properly prefixed, if two tables had the same column name an
  	ambiguous column name message would result.
  - fix: if-then-else expression generated incorrect code.
* XML Ooutput:
  - new output in columns: attribute references mentions the Xplain
    type, if any, the attribute references. And sqlReferences mentions
    the SQL table name.
  - if an attribute is marked as optional, the optional attribute is
    now set to true.
  - if an attribute is marked as unique, the unique attribute is
    now set to true.
  - crash when a get with a function used an expression to calculate
    the total (total t its a * 2).


New in release 3.0 <2007-03-10>

* assert statement supported for all dialects.
* if-then-else support in init [default] statements for dialects
	that support triggers.
* error reporting improved.
* delete support enhanced for dialects that do not support a join clause in
	the delete statement. A subselect is now emitted for such dialects.
* incorrect SQL output for expressions that didn't have explicit
  parentheses, for example the expression 5 - 3 + 3 was translated to
  5 - (3 + 3), perhaps giving unexpected. No implicit parentheses are
  added anymore unless explicitly provided. We now depend on the SQL
  dialect to do the right thing...
* if an attribute has been marked as optional, the SQL output now
	emits a proper left outer join instead of a join.
* XML description:
  - select statement now contains the name of the table
   	where the select came from.
  - output for identifier and ncname was incorrect when the name
  	started with a number. This is possible when using quoted
  	names. But the result isn't a valid identifier in most languages.
  - includes the best matching XML Schema data type.
* PostgreSQL:
  - slightly different output: names of parameters are now prefixed
    with a_ instead of my_. If you have explicit SQL in your
    PostgreSQL procedures, you'll have to correct them.
  - any value which was updated, was declared twice.
  - support for procedures with get with function (i.e. get count t).
  - Emitted code is still at PostgreSQL 7.3 level, but should now work
    fine with PostgreSQL 8. For example update and delete generated a
    "return 0" statement which isn't valid for PostgreSQL 8 when a
    function returns void.
* DB2:
  - output for procedure that had a get with a function was incorrect.
  - string concatenation operator set.
* MySQL 5:
   - emit drop if exists statement before creating a table.
   - a procedure with an extend could not be called twice in the same
     connection, because the temporary table would already exist as MySQL
     doesn't automatically drop them when exiting a procedure. Now
     temporary tables are dropped if they exist, before creating them.
   - wrong default value "-" when an init statement assigned
	   systemdate to a date.
* Oracle:
  - extend output changes: no index created for temporary	extend table.
  - init [default] support.
* SQLite:
  - assert output did not emit the proper view dialect.
  - string concatenation operator set.
* Manual: new chapter on using xplain2sql in legacy environments.
* Middleware:
  - New .xsl template (ecli_instance) for Eiffel and supporting classes.
  - ecli_stored_procedure.xsl updated.


New in 2.4 <2006-06-16>
* complex init (not an init default) is now translated to a non-null
  column if possible. In such a case a default clause is emitted and
  the actual value is supplied by a trigger. Previously the column was
  null to allow the trigger to update the value, but a default clause
  seems to work on many dialects.
* some assert support for Microsoft SQL and InterBase. Only simple
  expressions (a * b) supported. Assert domain not yet checked.
* init expression that was a literal or constant was treated as an
	init default expression, i.e. it could be overwritten at insert
	time.
* init [default] expressions didn't work for many dialects when a
	expression was used that involved multiplication or a
	function.
* better error messages in various cases.
* If an undeclared parameter is used inside a procedure, an error
	is now emitted. Previously wrong code was generated.
* Quite complete support for SQLite 3.
* MySQL 5 support added. Very complete, MySQL 5 is a real database.
* Microsoft SQL:
  - not literal init default was treated as init.
  - some support sql Microsoft SQL 2000: large integers now use
    bigint. The -tsql switch now emits Microsoft SQL 2000.
* Interbase 6:
  - non constant init default was treated as init.
  - incorrect SQL in case init [default] was not a constant.
  - any and nil functions are now properly supported.
  - workaround for missing coalesce function implemented. This means
    that functions like min or max can now be	used safely.
  - Boolean domain now includes proper checks that its value can only
    be null, a 'T' or an 'F'.
* InterBase 4: support dropped.
* DB2:
  - incorrect SQL in case init [default] was not a constant.
  - full init [default] support added.
* PostgreSQL 7.3
  - name and time column names don't need to be treates specially as
    they did in earlier versions.
  - output now removes the generated return type for a procedure that
    returns a result set. Makes it easier to copy/paste output.
* PostgreSQL:
  - treated init default as init.
  - incorrect code was emited when using values in a stored procedure.
  - index on extend wasn't create inside a stored procedure due to a
    wrongly inserted if statement.
* new options:
  - New option -pkformat.
* an unrecognised command-line option is now treated as a fatal error.



New in 2.2 <2005-03-01>

* Column number is now reported for warnings.
* A previously declared value can now be updated, i.e. given a new value.
* An extend now always create a unique index on the primary key
	column of the extended table. Speeds up certain queries
	enormously. Use -noextendindex to disable this behaviour.
* Support for the four conversion functions integer (), real (),
  string () and datef().
* All mathematical functions are now recognized as keywords, no code
  is emitted though.
* Added support for the * and ? operators. If these two characters
  appear in a literal string, the comparison is done with like. An
  unfortunate side effect of this change is that these two characters
  can no longer be used for literal searches. You can work around this
  by assinging the string to a value and compare using the value instead
  of the literal string.
* Constraint names no longer include a number unless they are
  unique. Use the "-oldconstraintnames" option to revert to the
  previously generated names.
* Changes to command-line options:
  - New option -nospprefix to emit the "sp_" prefix for stored procedure
    names.
  - Use the "-oldconstraintnames" option to use old style constraint names.
  - support for -inheritkey switch is dropped.
* New style sheets:
  - New example style sheet delphi_makefile.xsl that shows how to
  	generate a makefile which generates all the classes that were
  	previously created with the -delphi switch.
  - New style sheet rename_sp.xsl that emits rename statements for
    Microsoft SQL Server in case the new -nospprefix option is used.
    Give an xplain2sql.xml as input.
* InterBase SQL:
  - when an index was created on an extend, a non-unique name could be
    generated fairly easily. The current method is somewhat more
    robust, but can still be fooled.
* Oracle:
  - forbids updating the primary key.
  - sequence sets maximum value for a trigger based on primary key length.
* PostgreSQL:
  - fix when setting a value inside an expression inside a stored procedure.
  - fix when using a value inside an expression inside a stored procedure.
  - output for procedures with more than one parameter was incorrect.
  - it is now possible to call a procecure that has an extend multiple
    times per session.
  - supports the some function for version 7.3 or higher.
  - purging of constants is supported.
  - procedures that return a result set emit different code for 7.3 or
    higher. The new aproach available in 7.3 is far more user friendly
    and works great through an ODBC interface for example.
  - added -pgsql72 switch to generate slightly different code.
* Microsoft SQL Server (Transact SQL):
  - uses set instead of select to set a value (7.0 or higher).
  - every procedure now sets xact abort. Errors inside the procedure
    will rollback the transaction.
  - Use "recompiled procedure" instead of "procedure" to create a
    procedure that has the "with recompile" option.
  - now emits a like operator when comparing a string to a text field.



New in 2.0 - <2003-09-18>

* (A) domain is now translated to a VARYING CHARACTER. The (V) domain
  is obsolete. Use the (C) domain to output just a CHARACTER data type.
  Use the -oldA switch to revert xplain2sql to its former behavior.
* Corrected parsing of inserts with auto generated primary key. Use
  a * instead of a "*" to signify this.
* extend names now should be unique, i.e. they should not be the
	same as an existing base, type, value or constant.
* XML output with -xml option. Generates an XML description of what
  code has been generated for the target SQL dialect. The -delphi and
  -ado switches will become obsolete with this.
* The -delphi -ado output should now work with Delphi 7.
* Limited support of using and updating extended columns in updates.
* Use of extended columns in delete statement supported.
* If an attribute has an init statement, it is no longer listed
	as a parameter in the insert stored procedure.
* Support for writing stored procedures in Xplain, see
  manual. Supported on Microsoft SQL Server, DB/2, PostgreSQL, InterBase
  and Oracle.
* get statement now always outputs an order by clause. The default
	is the instance id. This is a breaking change for code that relies
	on some unspecified default sort order. But that code was broken
	anyway, any change in index could have changed the sort order.
* extended names now should be unique, i.e. they should not be the
	same as an existing base, type, value or constant.
* SQL code for Xplain set functions looks sometimes different. Code
  rewritten, might cause bugs.
* Fairly complete output for Oracle, see manual for details.
* DB/2 output does now have insert/update/delete stored procedures.
* PostgreSQL output does not have insert/update/delete stored procedures.
* PostgreSQL output updated to 7.3.3. Support for earlier version is
  dropped. Can be brought back on request.
* Boolean return values for Microsoft SQL Server now return a bit
  value instead of an integer.
* Output for Microsoft SQL Server optimized. Now emits a join instead of
  subselect when updating attributes with extended columns.
* Support for comparisons with Null. Useful when dealing with linked
  lists and finding the head or tail.
* License update to Eiffel Forum License v2.
* History file is obsolete, see ChangeLog
