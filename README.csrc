This archive contains the xplain2sql source code in C form.
The original sources are written with Eiffel.

Compile these sources on your platform by typing:

    make


This should produce the executable xplain2sql.

If you use Borland C type instead:

    make xplain2sql-bcc


I'm not sure if the source file is too large. Let
me know if you have problems compiling it.
