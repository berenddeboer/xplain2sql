2020-01-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* xplain2sql.xml: emits <insert>, <update> and <delete> tags
	inside a <storedProcedure> if the procedure executes any of these
	statements. This allows you to distinguish between procedures that
	query or mutate data.

	* !Postgresql 9.5: Added option -iso8601date to force all dates to
	be emitted in ISO 8601 format. This date format is compatible with
	what AppSync expects. No need to add custom SQL functions to
	output to get the right date, which also has the problem that the
	date type disappears and becomes a generic string. Now everything
	is still seen as a date, and returned properly.


2020-01-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* !Postgresql 9.5: created function output time now has a better
	name if you used the advanced feature of calling a custom SQL
	function. For example: "select $`to_json'(created) from mytable"
	will now emit the nicer "created" field for this type instead of
	"to_json". Previously you had to use: "select $`to_json'(created)
	as created from mytable".

	* !Postgresql 9.5: now emits "create table if not exists", more
	compatible with how functions are created, and makes it easier to
	rerun a script if the tables themselves have not changd.


2020-01-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* !Added -version option to print the current version.


2018-01-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Release 5.0.

	* Microsoft SQL: incorrect code for an existential extend.

	* SQLite: incorrect code generated when an expression instead of
	constant was used as default value for an attribute.

	* DB2: incorrect code generated when updating an attribute from an extend.

	* Add option -noextendview so updateable extends are generated
  	outside a stored procedure.

	* xplain2sql compiles with gec again.


2017-09-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Microsoft SQL: Add support for SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL
	Database: generate drop table if exist and drop procedure if exist.


2017-08-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Microsoft SQL: doesn't like it when a value got redeclared in a
	stored procedure, which could happen if we think the type has
	changed. But in a stored procedure we should never redeclare a
	value.


2017-05-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Postgresql 9.5: picture data type is now a bytea.


2017-05-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Postgresql 9.5: The real() function maps to the numeric data
	type with no specified limits on the before/after precision. This
	more closely maps Xplain expected behaviour, and avoids casting
	issues.

	* If an extend has an explicit representation, the resulting
	column is cast to that representation, instead of relying upon
	what the particular SQL implementation decides the resulting type
	will be.

	* Postgresql 7.3 and up: add support for Xplain's newdate function.

	* Postgresql 9.5: experiment: let procedure that returns just a
	value, return that as a value, no longer as a set. This may become
	an option, as it is quite a break from previous behaviour, and
	makes code inconsistent across various databases.


	* value expression in procedures: values could not freely use
   	parameters in expressions.

	* constant value assignment: now properly rejects a value being
	used in an expression. Also a constant cannot be given a new value.


2017-05-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL 9.5: support named parameters.


2017-02-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fix error where we wrongly complained value was set again, but not when a base or type was redefined.


2017-02-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: generated stored procedure was incorrect when it
	contained a get using division on an integer property: the
	generated type should have been a float, but was still an integer.


2017-02-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Didn't determine properly when a property wasn't part of a type,
	leading subsequent crash.


2016-05-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Updated all Eiffel code to latest standard.


2016-04-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Beta release 4.1.3.


2014-08-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed bug: view was always created inside stored procedure, but
  	  should have stayed a temporary table.


2014-06-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Extend: now generates view instead of (temporary) table when not used inside a procedure.


2011-12-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Beta release 4.1.0.


2010-06-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Assertion output was still incorrect with new extend
	optimisation. Should use a left join when retrieving attributes.


2010-05-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Extend output was incorrect with new extend optimisation when
	extend contained a where clause with or.

	* Assertion code was incorrect with new extend optimsation.


2010-01-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Extend with logical expression code optimisation.


2010-01-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Extend with any/nil function code optimisation in
	case the extended attribute is not update in a procedure.


2009-12-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: proper support for some function as limit can be used in
	subqueries as well.


2009-12-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: minimum value for a date was set to 0000-01-01, but
	that date is rejected with version 8.4. So minimum value is now
	0001-01-01.


2009-06-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* extend with any/nil now emits a '1' instead of a column name in
	the subselect. Works much better with MySQL's 'optimiser'.


2009-05-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* string(): when string() cast function was used in a string
	concatenation, SQL output was incorrect.


2009-05-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Assertion in SQL select was done with an inner join instead of a
	left outer join. Inner join is incorrect when the assertion is a
	some function as there might be no data.


2009-04-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Supported purge of assertions.


2009-02-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Optimized output for any/nil: they're now done with a left outer
	join, instead of a subselect. This gives a huge performance boost
	under MySQL.


2008-12-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Extend optimization: if extend not updated, generate optimized
	output. Does wonders for MySQL 5. Also fixed bug where extra
	temporary table step was inserted unnecessarily.


2008-11-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Didn't generate a proper column name for get max/get min.


2008-11-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: now drops procedures before creating them, so running
	the script against an existing database is easier.


2008-11-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: now drops views create for asserts, so running the
	script against an existing database is easier.


2008-10-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* value statement didn't accept systemdate or loginname.


2008-10-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL: it seems the dual table doesn't really behave like a
	table with a single row. The output now generates a dual itself
	and uses that.


2008-10-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL: extend with where claused caused a self select against a
	temporary table which MySQL doesn't support.


2008-08-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Value inside stored procedure would not get proper type if it
	was initialised by assigning a parameter.

	* When a value was purged, it was still listed as being in use,
	so when reusing it again or using it inside stored procedures it
	was not properly redeclared.


2008-08-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 4.0.1 of xplain2sql.

	* xplain2sql identified itself as 3.9.0-rc2.

	* Fixed parser bug in value definition: the expression inside an
	integer/datef/real/string cast could only be a constant. But any
	expression should be allowed actually.


2008-08-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 4.0.0.


2008-08-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output: emit unique="true" when an attribute has the unique
	property.


2008-07-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 3.9.0 (rc1 for release 4.0):

	* DB2: set correct string concatenation operator to ||.


2008-07-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SQLite 3: set correct string concatenation operator
	to ||.

	* InterBase/FireBird: set correct string concatenation operator
	to ||.


2008-07-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SQL code generation: output for update with where statement that
	had an or in it, could have updated all rows in table as
	parenthesis were missing. Example:

	  update t "1" its a1 = "test" where a2 = "0" or a3 = "0".


2008-07-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Firebird 2.1: fixed another situation where output
	failed. Basically have to sprinle commits now and then.


2008-06-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* FireBird 2.1 now uses coalesce.


2008-06-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Beta release 3.1.2.

	* Added support for FireBird 2.1. Output works, and support for
	global tempory table added. Also emits create sequence instead of
	create generator.

	* Changed license to MIT.


2008-06-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL 8.2: start with PostgrSQL 8.2 specific output. One
	change is that the drop type now adds if exists to cut down on the
	number of errors.


2008-05-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SQL code generation: new left outer join SQL was incorrect when
	a count extend had a where clause that used extends or attributes
	in other tables.

	* SQL code generation: didn't emit parenthesises for an extend of
	the form:

	    extend t with e = (not (b1 or b2)).

	  This was translated to SQL as if the user had written:

	    extend t with e = (not b1 or b2).

	  Which obviously is very different.


2008-04-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: Date type is now emitted as timestamp with time
	zone. This will be done for all other dialects as far as they
	support this as it allows a database where users in various time
	zones can see times in their local time without needing conversion
	of those times by other software.


2008-03-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* The parser now finds names as "week 1 date" a valid name. Names
	still have to start with a character, but numbers in names now
	accepted as well. Leads to less contrived names in some cases.


2008-02-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Xplain combine function now takes any number of operands,
	making it more convenient to use.


2008-02-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: string concatenation was done with "+", should have
	been using the concat operator.


2008-01-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output: if an attribute is marked as optional, the optional
	attribute is now set to true.


2008-01-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: combine function now correctly generates the
	PostgreSQL string concatenator.

	* Value definition parsing did not allow an and/or of two
	values. So a statement like:

	  v1 = true.
	  v2 = false.
	  v3 = v1 and v2.

	was forbidden. Solving this added a shift/reduce conflict, but
	seems harmless at the moment.


2007-12-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Improved error message when per property clause is incorrect.

	* Fixed a long standing bug (from the beginning?) where an extend
	would not use a long enough column name, if there was a value
	statement somewhere before it, and the column name had to be
	larger than 250 characters. After the value statement, the maximum
	number of characters was always 250.

	* xplain2sql didn't handle absolute paths in include or use. It
	does now for unix style paths.

	* Slightly optimized output when an extend is created in a procedure.

	* The like operator was only used when a property was compared
	with a string and the string contained the "%" character. But if
	you use the combine function and one of the strings has a "*" in
	it, the like operator will now also be used instead of the
	equals.


2007-12-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* It's now possible to use if then else in a property list, such
	as	:

	  get t1 its if a1 then "yes" else "no".

	Due to parsing issues an if instruction cannot occur as part of an
	expression so things like 1 + if a1 then 2 else 3 won't work.


2007-12-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Boolean parameters to a procedure generated a parsing error when
	used in a logical expression.


2007-12-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 3.1.1. More testing done.

	* Fixed bug in MySQL5 where update of extend using a literal
	  produced wrong code (bug introduced after last official release).

	* Fixed bug where output of function using left outer joins was
	  wrong when another extension was involved.


2007-12-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output for the columns of a table has two new attributes:
	references is the type to which the attribute references if the
	attribute is a generalization. sqlReferences is the table name in
	that case.


2007-12-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Domain (C2) emitted a varchar instead of char (Fidel).


2007-12-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Value definition did not support the type cast functions like
	real. Having those is really useful when calling externaly
	functions for which xplain2sql doesn't have the type information
	so they are always defined as varchar(255). But by adding an
	explicit cast the value will have the correct type.


2007-12-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: can now create special procedure "trigger
	procedure" instead of just "procedure" which generates output so
	the stored procedure can be used as a trigger.

	* beta release 3.1.0. However has undergone minimal testing.

	* Literal SQL expression wasn't allowed in a value definition.


2007-10-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: return a value from within a stored procedure returned
	an ugly column name, something as @"last_customer". Now the column
	name looks better, but this change might break existing code.


2007-07-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output: crash when a get with a function used an expression
	to calculate the total (total t its a * 2).

	* PostgreSQL: crash when a get with a function used an expression
	to calculate the total (total t its a * 2).


2007-05-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: breaking change: PostgreSQL doesn't really support
	identifiers with spaces, for example if you have a sequential
	primary key column with a space in it, PostgreSQL will generate an
	implicit sequence which will have a name also with a space in
	it. But you won't be able to access that sequence ever, PostgreSQL
	will give the strange warning 'invalid name syntax'. So PostgreSQL
	no longer emits spaces for names, they're always replaced by
	underscores, until this issue gets fixed.

	* PostgreSQL 8.1: plsql code stored procedures is no longer
	emited in a quoted block but it uses the $$ characters as
	delimiter.

	* PostgreSQL: get max t its some_date emitted incorrect SQL when
	used inside a procedure.

	* crash when extending a type twice with the same attribute name,
	instead of a proper error message.


2007-05-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* xplain2sql didn't handle an init of the form:

	    init t its b = (name = "boss").

	This was due to the fact that this was illegal syntax according to
	the Xplain BNF, but there's not reason to forbid it, it's probably
	an oversight in the official manual. Because of parsing issues,
	logical expressions need to be between parenthesis.

	* SQL optimization: most optimizers handle joins better than
	subselect these days, especially mysql handles subselect pretty
	badly. xplain2sql now emits (left outer) joins + a group by for
	the count, min, max and total functions, leading to much better
	code. The some function could be optimized in certain cases as
	well, but that's not yet done.

2007-05-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Xplain extension to mimick SQL insert into ... select:

	    get type1 its attribute1, attribute2
	    insert type2 its attribute3, attribute4.

	  It allows multiple inserts into a destination table from a
	  source table. Useful for backups or copying configurations to an
	  order for example.


2007-05-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* assertion statement generated wrong code with a function
	expression.


2007-05-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: if an Xplain function called a user procedure to
	return the value of an attribute, xplain2sql would crash if that
	statement appeared inside a procedure.


42007-05-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* assert statement generated wrong code when its expression
	used another asserted attribute.

2007-05-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Crash when reading file from stdin (thanks Josh Purinton), as
	in xplain2sql < ../samples/test.ddl.


2007-04-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Support added for extension with explicit domain. Useful when
	representation cannot be calculated, for example if you extend by
	calling a user defined SQL function.


2007-04-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: support for using extended attributes in where clause
	of delete.

	* SQL Server: if-then-else expression generated incorrect code.

	* SQL Server: complex update fix, columns in set expression were
	not properly prefixed, if two tables had the same column name an
	ambiguous column name message would result.

	* SQL Server: complex update of an extension generated a left
	outer join in from clause instead of inner join.

	* PostgreSQL 8.1 support added. Default pgsql is now PostgreSQL
	8.1.

	* All dialects should now allow updating of attributes
	with any value, be it another extended attribute or an its list.

	* All dialects should now allow updating of extended attributes
	with any value, be it another extended attribute or an its list.


2007-03-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 3.0.


2007-03-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output now includes the best matching XML Schema data type.

	* MySQL 5: temporary tables were not dropped at the end of a
	procedure, so explicit drops added before creating them.

	* MySQL 5: wrong default value "-" when an init statement assigned
	systemdate to a date.


2007-03-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 2.5.1.


2007-02-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5: emit drop if exists statement before creating a table.


2007-01-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Oracle: extend output changes: no index created for temporary
	extend table. And preserves rows accross commits, because it is
	somewhat unclear what a commit is. It empties the table too soon
	without it, better to retain the data.

	* SQLite: assert output did not emit the proper view dialect.

	* Oracle: init [default] support.

	* if-then-else support in init [default] statements for dialects
	that support triggers.


2007-01-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 2.5.0.

	* Oracle output postcondition violation when compiled with ISE
	  5.6 for type representation (I10).

	* Some example Eiffel classes and style sheets added to generate
	Eiffel middleware code using ECLI, see ecli_instance.xsl.

	* Additional chapter in manual detailing how to use xplain2sql i
	a legacy environment.

	* DB2: output for procedure containing get with function was
	incorrect.


2007-01-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Error reporting improved in certain cases.

	* Full assertion supported added for all dialects, including
	complex and functions.


2006-12-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SQL: conversion for "- (a + b)" with explicit parentheses would
	also lead to incorrect output.

	* SQL: serious issue with translation: output emitted additional
	parentheses, but that doesn't work in the case of: 5 - 3 + 3. The
	anser is five, but xplain2sql turned this into 5 - (3 + 3), giving
	-1 as the answer...
	No implicit parentheses are added anymore unless explicitly provided.


2006-11-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Ugly hack added: you can now use '{' the insert SQL at any point
	in an expression. The SQL is taken literally and inserted.


2006-09-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Slightly different output for PostgreSQL stored
	procedures. Names of parameters are now prefixed with 'a_' instead
	of 'my_'.

	* Value statement now also support calling existing SQL functions.


2006-09-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Support added for dialects that do not support a join clause in
	the delete statement. A subselect is now emitted for such dialects.


2006-09-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* if an attribute has been marked as optional, the SQL output now
	does a left outer join. You shouldn't use the optional keyword in
	applications developed from scratch in Xplain, but to support
	legacy apps with an Xpain layer this can be quite valuable.


2006-09-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: any value which was updated, was declared twice.


2006-08-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* inserted keyword did not handle incorrect type.


2006-07-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Warning is now given when a parameter to a stored procedure is
	not used.

	* Min or max function required a property, if one was absent the
	parser would still accept it, but crash later one for particular
	dialects. Now the parser generates a proper error message.

	* PostgreSQL: procedures with a get with function (i.e. get count
	something) were not implemented and when used, generated incorrect
	sql.


2006-07-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output for identifier and ncname was incorrect when the name
	started with a number. This is possible when using quoted
	names. But the result isn't a valid identifier in most languages.


2006-06-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL 7.3: generated stored procedures for update and
	delete had a "return 0" statement which isn't valid for PostgreSQL
	8 when a function returns void.


2006-06-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output: select statement now contains the name of the table
	where the select came from.


2006-06-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL file listed incorrect requirements (Roger Browne).


2006-06-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 2.4.


2006-06-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* if attribute listed after per was a known base or type, but not
	the proper attribute of the type in question, a precondition
	violation occurred. This did not affect the release version.


2006-06-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: incorrect code was emited when using values in a
	stored procedure.


2006-05-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL 7.3: name and time column names don't need to be
	treates specially as they did in earlier versions. PostgreSQL 7.2
	output still renames a column name to "name_".


2006-05-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL: index on extend wasn't create inside a stored
	procedure due to a wrongly inserted if statement.


2006-05-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* New option -pkformat. Next argument is the format of the primary
	key. By default the primary key is "id_<type name>" but with:

	  -pkformat '$s_id'

	this can be changed to "<type name>_id" for example. Useful when
	trying to emulate output for an existing database. Note: in
	Makefiles use something -pkformat '$$s_id'.


2006-01-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL output now removes the generated return type for a
	procedure that returns a result set. If this does not exist, a
	warning message will be printed that can be ignored. Unfortunately
	one cannot suppress this warning, but the resulting output is much
	easier to copy and paste when one just wants to replace a stored
	procedure.


2005-12-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* init expression that was a literal or constant was treated as an
	init default expression, i.e. it could be overwritten at insert
	time.

	* Warning if an insert statement contains an assignment to an
	attribute for which an init expression has been specified.

	* Check if trajectory's lower value is higher than the upper value
	in case the trajectory's numbers are 32 bit integers.

	* Check if real trajectory fits in real domain.

	* Check if integer enumeration fits in specified integer domain.

	* Better error message if trajectory ("..") is used in an
	enumeration.


2005-12-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Init [default] expressions didn't work for many dialects when a
	expression was used that involved multiplication or a
	function. For example:
	  init default sale its discount = price * 0.10
	would give incorrect SQL.


2005-12-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 2.3.

	* An unrecognised command-line option is now treated as a fatal
	error.


2005-12-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Microsoft SQL output for a non literal init default was treated
	as an init.

	* InterBase 6 output treated a non constant init default as init.

	* InterBase 6 emitted incorrect SQL in case an init expression was
	not a constant.

	* DB2 has now full init (default) support, i.e. anything
	else than a constant value is now supported as well.

	* An init (not an init default) other than a constant is now
	converted slightly differently for some dialects. If such an init
	had been specified, previously the column would allow a null
	value. Now a default is specified and the trigger should set the
	column to a proper value. Proper dialects check the null status of
	a column after the trigger has been fired. In such cases the
	column will always be not null. If dialects check the null status
	of a column before firing the trigger, the column will still be
	null.
	Note that an init default still produces a column which allows
	null. This in order to be able distinguish if a user has supplied
	a value or not.


2005-11-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* DB2 output was wrong in case an init was an expression like 33
	   2. Defaults in DB2 can only be constants.

	* PostgreSQL treated init default als init. It now treats them
	appropriately.

	* Moved trigger support from SQL_GENERATOR to
	SQL_GENERATOR_WITH_TRIGGERS.


2005-11-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Moved stored procedure support from SQL_GENERATOR to
	SQL_GENERATOR_WITH_SP. Cleans up code a bit and generators without
	this don't have to undefine lots what shouldn't trouble them in
	the first place.

	* SQLite 3 support. Quite complete.


2005-11-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MySQL 5 support, very complete. Finally looks like a real
	database! Values are now connection specific. Subselects are
	supported. User procedures are now supported.


2005-06-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Scanner now uses the new typing stuff introduced by Gobo 3.2.

	* Updated code to compile with latest rewrite of string formatting
	routines in Gobo.


2005-06-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* assert support for Transact-SQL and InterBase. Only supports
	simple expressions (like price * quantity) and they are translated
	to computed columns. The assert's domain restriction is not
	checked.

	* SQL Server 2000 support: -tsql or -tsql2000 actives this new
	target. Be warned that for the (I1) and (I2) data type no longer a
	tinyint is emitted. A tinyint has a range of 0..255, while in
	Xplain (I1) and (I2) can be negative as well. The SQL Server 7
	target -tsql70 still emits tinyints in order not to break existing
	code.
	SQL Server 2000 supports big integers (up to (I19) before
	switching to the numeric data type). Reals can range from (R1,37)
	to (R38,0).


2005-06-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* If an undeclared parameter is used inside a procedure, an error
	is now emitted, previously the xplain2sql generated (wrong)
	code anyway.


2005-06-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* InterBase: workaround for missing coalesce function
	implemented. This means that functions like min or max can now be
	used safely.


2005-06-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* There is now a warning if an integer trajectory exceeds the
	limit of the defined integer. I.e. if you specify the trajectory
	(1..100) for (I2). This should be (1..99) to avoid the warning.

	* InterBase: Boolean domain now includes proper checks that its
	value can only be null, a 'T' or an 'F'.

	* InterBase: use of any and nil functions in an extend in
	InterBase generated incorrect output. The select statement in
	InterBase needs a from table, and the output didn't use the
	InterBase equivalent of the Oracle dual table.

	* InterBase 4: support dropped.


2005-03-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 2.2.


2005-02-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* rename_sp.xsl: stored procedure that emits rename statements for
	Microsft SQL Server in case one wants to use the new -nospprefix
	option.


2005-02-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 2.1.1 released.

	* delph_makefile.xsl: new example style sheet that shows how to
	generate a makefile which generates all the classes that were
	previously created with the -delphi switch.


2005-01-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* InterBase and PostgreSQL index names are global. Method of
	generating index names for extends could therefore easily generate
	a non-unique index if the name of the extended attribute was the
	same for two different tables. Now the table name is included in
	the name as well.


2005-01-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* All stored procedures started with the "sp_" prefix. This seems
	to have some performance impact with Micrsoft SQL Server as it
	looks in the master database first. It's unsure if this is
	noticable, but there is a new option "-nospprefix" that creates
	stored procedure names without any prefix (Jacco Eerland).

	* Constraint names now only add a number to the name if the name
	is not unique. This should help with creating update scripts
	(Servaas Goossen). Use "-oldconstraintnames" to get the previous
	behaviour in case the new behaviour doesn't work.


2004-11-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Transact SQL output: use set instead of select to change a
	value.


2004-10-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Using a value in an expression inside a PostgreSQL stored
	procedure generated incorrect code.

	* Code for assigning the result of a set function to a value
	inside a stored procedure generated incorrect code for Postgres
	SQL.


2004-10-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* xplain2sql now supports giving a value a new value within the
	same scope. Previously this led to a warning and possibly
	incorrect code generation. Full support is only provided for SQL
	dialects that support variables in all cases (not just procedures)
	or support dropping columns from a table.


2004-08-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* It is now possible to create a "recompiled procedure" instead of
	just a "procedure". Only useful for SQL Server, emits a procedure
	with the 'with recompile' option.
	It seems SQL Server 2000 cached execution plans for temporary
	tables with the same names, although created in different stored
	procedures and with wildly different content. This leads to havoc
	in certain cases (execution times of hours).


2004-03-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 2.1 released.


2004-03-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Oracle output now forbids updating the primary key.

	* -view option now properly quotes names (thanks Martin van
	Dinther). But -view is not an option that adds something at the
	moment.

	* Oracle sequence now includes the maximum value allowed for the
	type that has an auto-generated primary key. Thanks to Martin van
	Dinther for the suggestions.

	* The minimum value of an Oracle sequence does not start with 1000
	if the primary key is of length 3 or less.

	* Column number is now reported on errors or warnings.

	* Line/column number is now counted differently. That fixed a
	problem where line numbers were incorrect with multi-line strings.


2004-02-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added support for the four conversion functions integer (),
	real (), string () and datef(). xplain2sql does no checks yet, so
	casting a "1" to a date will probably not work. And PostgreSQL
	doesn't seem to like conversion of varchar columns to integer or
	floats.


2004-02-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* If you had more than one parameter for a PostgreSQL procedure,
	the output was incorrect. Basically the second and next parameters
	had the same value as the first parameter.


2004-01-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* All mathematical functions are now recognized as keywords. Now
	code is as yet generated.


2004-01-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* PostgreSQL output now empties an existing temporary
	table. Temporary tables are created when an extend is created. It
	is now possible to call a stored procedure that creates an extend
	multiple times per session. Previously the stored procedure would
	fail the second time, because the extend did already exist and the
	code tried to create it again.


2004-01-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* PostgresSQL output caused a crash for a get statement with an
	expression (for example a + b) inside a stored procedure.


2003-12-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* InterBase code does not generate default values anymore when
	there is nothing to insert. Could happen in an insert stored
	procedure.

	* Fixed crashes in debug mode when using an empty string or when using
	"""".


2003-12-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Microsoft SQL Server wants to see a like operator when comparing
	a string to a text (memo) field.


2003-12-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added support for the * and ? operators. When these two
	characters occur in a constant string, the like operator is used
	instead of the equality operator.
	Using wild cards without a special operator is a mistake in my
	opinion. Perhaps a future version will introduce the like and not
	like operators.


2003-12-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* If a file was included with a .use (i.e. don't generate code for
	it) and that file had a .include, code was generated for the
	.include and the last statement before the .include.


2003-11-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* An alphanumeric primary key was still created with the char
	datatype instead of the varchar datatype. Should have switched
	when (A) was transformed to varchar (thanks to Martin van Dinther).


2003-11-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Transact SQL 7.0 now starts every procedure with set xact_abort
	on. Any error inside the stored procedure will abort the procedure
	and rollback the transaction.


2003-11-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added -pgsql72 switch to emit the older Postgres SQL. Not sure
	if everything works on 7.2 as it will not be regularly tested
	against that version.


2003-10-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML generation now includes whether an attribute is a
	specialization in the table output and select output in a
	procedure.


2003-10-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL now supports the some function. John Wiggins
	notified me that this should work in PostgreSQL 7.3, and it did
	indeed.


2003-10-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL now allows purging of constants (thanks John Wiggins
	for the suggestion).

	* PostgreSQL Procedures that return a result set now use new
	functionality available in 7.3. The output of xplain2sql is now
	really limited to postgreSQL 7.3.


2003-10-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Representation listed in xplain2sql.xml for output of the value
	statement for a character value was erroneously still (V). It is
	now (A).

	* Error is now reported when given primary key is not integer for
	insert on type with integer primary key.

	* Dropped support old style auto primary key, i.e. "*" instead of
	just *.

	* Dropped support for -delphi and -ado.

	* -inheritkey support dropped.

	* Extends now always create a unique index on the primary key
	column of the extended table. Speeds up certain queries
	enormously. Use -noextendindex to disable this behaviour.


2003-09-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Release 2.0.

	* Delphi mw_ado.pas file is changed to include ADOInt, the unit
	supplied with Delphi 5 and higher, instead of ADODB_TLB, a custom
	generated Delphi wrapper based on the ADO type library. This means
	that the current unit works with the XSLT script. It does no
	longer compile with the -delphi -ado output.

	* Added new script delphi_ado_class.xsl to translate a type in an
	xplain2sql.xml file to a middleware class for Delphi. This will
	replace the existing -ado -delphi stuff that was fairly specific
	for a single company.


2003-09-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Transact-SQL 7 code emited a "distinct top 1" for the some
	function. That distinct should not be there and in fact, it slowed
	down queries enormously.

	* Crash if attempt was made to refer to attribute of extension
	that was a type. No crash now, you get warning that extension
	doesn't have that attribute. This should work in a future release.


2003-09-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Quoted strings were not handled correctly. Quoting should be
	done like this

	  "this "" is a double quote"

	However, the output did have "" instead of just a single ".


2003-08-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Delphi ADO generator emitted adChar for A data type. Due to
	change to output of varchar for A data type, it now emits
	adVarChar. Doesn't seem compatible with the -oldvarchar option I'm
	afraid. As I no longer use this option, please let me know if this
	is a problem for anyone.


2003-08-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* XML output now emits the insert/update/delete parameter name
	for every column.


2003-08-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* When an A representation was used in the output, the XML
	representation emitted the obsolete V representation.


2003-08-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release candidate 2, version 1.9.3.


2003-08-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Delphi ADO middleware generation changed so it compiles with
	Delphi 7. Thanks to Jacco Eerland for suggesting this fix.


2003-08-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Transact SQL update output produced better code because a from
	clause is now emitted. So no subselects are needed to retrieve
	information.

	* Because Transact-SQL supports a from clause in an update and
	delete statement, the output for selecting a value of an extended
	column didn't need to use subselects. And subselects are slow in
	Transact-SQL.


2003-07-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Oracle doesn't have True Booleans as well. Output now turns
	expressions into the emulated char(1).

	* Output for Oracle now includes an exit statement at the end.


2003-07-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* A count didn't have a coalesce because I thought null values
	couldn't occur. That's wrong, in the following example attributes
	can be null and SQL Dialects might complain about discarding null
	values.

	  get node = prev_node.
	  count node its prev_node.

	In such cases a coalesce is added to the count and all prev_nodes
	that are null are counted as a single distinct value. This is
	unlike SQL where a null isn't equal to any other null.


2003-07-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* And there were more cases where a Boolean didn't work correctly
	for SQL Server. Basic issue is that SQL Server doesn't have a True
	Boolean data type. I hope I fixed them all now.

	* Generated code for SQL Server was not correct when a Boolean
	value was assigned to a value. Example:

	   value v = (1 = 2).

	Now Boolean expressions should be correctly cast to Booleans in
	all cases.


2003-07-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Generated SQL for updating an extended attribute with a literal
	value was not optimal for Microsoft SQL Server.


2003-07-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 1.9.2.

2003-07-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Oracle treats empty strings as nulls. As Xplain does not support
	nulls, empty strings are emitted as a string with a single space.


2003-07-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PostgreSQL does not seem to need a from clause I
	detected. That's good.

	* Output for value statement in DB2 stored procedure worked only
	when the XplainConstant table was created. I've detected the
	DB2 values statement, so it should work in more cases now.

	* Now uses SYSIBM.DUMMY1 for DB2 when a table with one row is
	needed. Users need to have select permissions on this table.

	* It seems the PostgreSQL setval function takes quoted
	identifiers. Perhaps earlier versions didn't? Now emits quoted
	identifers when correcting the auto-generated primary key if you
	have an insert with an explicit identify.

	* InterBase output now has correct insert stored procedure code
	when there are no input parameters. Can happen when there are
	inits on a type, so the insert can only have default values. As
	InterBase does not support the default values clause on an insert,
	the generated code is still incorrect though.

	* inserted statement (retrieves last auto-generated pk) did not
	generate code for InterBase.


2003-07-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* InterBase now supports stored procedures. For the first time,
	value statements are now really useful in InterBase. Output of a
	stored procedure when it emits a value or an instance can be
	different though. It should be equal, so both should return a
	result set. But I've no idea if this works at all.


2003-07-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* The value output in Transact SQL now has a proper column name,
	the name of the value itself. Previously the column was unnamed.

	* XML output now includes a new attribute ncname. This should be
	the identifier in SQL, without quotes and with spaces replaced by
	'-'. It is useful as a tag name in XML you might want to generate.


2003-07-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Interbase stored procedure output was incorrect if there were no
	parameters specified.


2003-06-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* It seems there is no Xplain syntax to delete an instance if you
	have an instance id in a value. Therefore I invented my own. Use
	the value between parentheses where an idstring is epxected. Example:

	  value my id = 1.
	  delete my type (my id).

	should now have the desired effect.

	* Unmanaged parameters had to be base or type names. That sort of
	defeated its entire purpose. I.e. if you had parameters with

	  :some name

	some name had to be a known base or type name. In 1.3.1 this was
	not necessary. And it should not be necessary.


2003-06-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* PostgreSQL now supports user procedures. Extends probably do not
	work. get and value statements are fine.

	* PostgreSQL output now generates insert/update/delete stored
	procedures.

	* This implies that output for PostgreSQL does now use ANSI 92
	style joins.

	* Updated PostgreSQL output to 7.3.3. Support for earlier versions
	is dropped, but if you really need it and 7.3.3 output doesn't
	work for you, let me know, and I'll bring it back in.


2003-06-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Boolean otput for SQL Server 7 is changed so it should now
	return a bit value instead of an integer value. This is done by
	emitting a cast(1 as bit) instead of just a 1.

	* It seems that xplain2sql is compilable again with SmartEiffel
	1.1rc1. The last version that could do that was 1.0 beta 2.


2003-05-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Delete statement for Transact-SQL can use an its in its where
	clause. This is not supported for all other dialects, but it
	wasn't in the docs.


2003-04-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 1.9.1.

	* license updated to Eiffel Forum License, version 2. This one is
	GPL and OSF compatible.

	* Oracle output does now do stored procedures.


2003-03-31  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Output for column A is now a varchar. Breaks previous behaviour!
	Use -oldA switch to have the behaviour where just a char was
	outputted.
	Use domain C to really get char output instead of varchar.


2003-01-31  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added support for comparison to NULL. This is useful when
	dealing with linked lists and finding the head or tail of it. I'm
	a bit unsure what the exact Xplain way is to deal with this, but
	the article "Semantic Modeling of Successive Events Applied to
	Version Management" led me to believe that these are the only
	allowed and sensible comparisons:

	  get t its a = null.
	  get t its a != null.

	Any other comparison, or even order like

	  get t its null = a.
	  get t its a > null.

	is rejected.


2003-01-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added function id() which is replaced by the id column of the
	table. Use of a function like this is probably extremely limited,
	and any appearance should be viewed with utmost suspicion.

	* Functions are now only parsed as functions when the next token
	is a '('. Previously names as 'string' or 'newdate' were forbidden
	as attribute names, because they would be recognized as
	functions. This is now allowed.


2003-01-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SQL output for some used a column name that was not prefixed.


2002-12-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* First stage of Oracle SQL dialect translation working.


2002-12-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Boolean assignment also didn't work for updates, i.e.:

	    update t its b = (a = 1).

	failed for Transact SQL as well. Works fine now.


2002-12-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Parser has become very strict where SQL was allowed. SQL code is
	now only allowed where an Xplain statement is allowed. Previously
	SQL code was dumped by the scanner, as soon as it was read, to
	standard output, so it could end up in any place. With this
	change, SQL code in stored procedures is now also supported.

	* MS SQL Server output now drops a procedure if it already
	exists. Makes it easier to rerun scripts.

	* Added support for extend with a boolean attribute for MS SQL
	Server. This dialect doesn't have a True Boolean data type, so now
	the proper mapping is generated to turn a True into a 1 and a
	False into a 0.


2002-11-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Output for get with function was wrong as it included a from
	table. So you basically got the functions value times every row in
	that table. The SQL code for a function has now been
	rewritten. This also influences the output of extends. Output
	looks shorter now, but I remember rewriting it already a few
	times, because of bugs in previous implementations. So perhaps old
	bugs pop up again )-:

	* delete supported in stored procedures.

	* update supported in stored procedures.

	* Very limited support for updating extended columns. The limit is
	in the where clause. Basically, no where clause is allowed. Or the
	where clause should just contain the extended column it
	self. Updating the extended column of a given single instance also
	works.

	* extended columns can now be used in delete statement.

	* get statement now always outputs an order by clause. The default
	is the instance id. This is a breaking change for code that relies
	on some unspecified default sort order. But that code was broken
	anyway, any change in index could have changed the sort order.


2002-10-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* extend names now should be unique, i.e. they should not be the
	same as an existing base, type, value or constant. The basic
	reason is a constant or value. For example the following code is
	ambiguous:

	  constant c (I1).
	  type t (I1) = a.
	  extend t with c = 1.
	  get t where a = c.

	Does the c refer to the constant or to the extension? To avoid
	this confusion, xplain2sql now refuses potentially ambiguous
	extension names.

	* Obscure -inheritkey option made obsolete. This was the way a
	predecessor of xplain2sq used to generate SQL. Didn't support
	multiple inheritance though. As it is not really supported, and I
	haven't used it for years, I'm phasing it out.

	* Added support for extend inside stored procedures.


2002-10-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* A get statement could be translated into a select statement that
	returned to many columns. This occurred when a join was needed in
	the select. I.e.

	  get t.

	became

	  select * from t

	while it should have been

	  select t.* from t

	Not all dialects support prefixing the * with the table name, so
	this issue is not solved. When a specific dialect has problems,
	let me know and I attempt to generate better code for that
	dialect. Also extended columns are not in the output, you have to
	use its to get them. This might change in the future.

	* Transact SQL code for advanced inits (that require selects) was
	not correct, it missed a set nocount, so the insert stored
	procedure didn't return the correct identifier or something like
	that. Or perhaps the additional result count disturbed code that
	read results sets.

	* If an attribute has an init statement, it is no longer listed
	as a parameter in the insert stored procedure. If it has an init
	default statement, it still is listed.


2002-10-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Now literal constants can be used in inserts. Previously a
	subselect was generated, which wasn't supported by many SQL
	dialects.


2002-10-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* New inserted keyword that returns the last inserted
	auto-generated primary key, very useful in stored procedures. Use
	as:

	  insert t * its a = "something".
	  last id = inserted t.

	Note that many SQL dialects (DB2, Microsoft TSQL) only can return
	the last inserted key, which is not type specific.

	* insert statement is supported in stored procedures.

	* Select of a value had set nocount on for SQL server. Not sure
	what would happen in that case, probably receiver wouldn't see the
	row, even if one was there.


2002-08-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added support for value inside stored procedures. Only Transact
	SQL and DB2 probably work correctly. On all platforms that do not
	support temporary tables, value does work correctly only in the
	single-user case.

	Note that for DB2 you *must* define an Xplain constant somewhere,
	because of some trick necessary to retrieve the value. A useful
	thing is to define a database version constant.

	* Name of table where Xplain constants were stored, was called
	XplainVariable. This was from the time I thought constants were
	variable, i.e. you could change them. That's not true,
	i.e. constants get there value during the data definition phase,
	and cannot be changed later. To better reflect this, the table is
	now called XplainConstant.


2002-08-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Support removed for old construct of instance selection in value
	selection. See for details the first comment in 1.0.3. Only the
	correct construct works now.

	* It seems I got the parsing for insert with automatic
	identification wrong. I asked the user to specify:

	  insert t "*" its a = 1.

	This should have been:

	  insert t * its a = 1.

	The old format is still supported, but a warning is generated.


2002-08-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Added -xml option, outputs description generated code to
	XML. This can be used in XSLT style sheet to develop code
	generators. Format of output is in mw_xplain2sql.dtd.

	* -ecli option removed. In time the -delphi option also will be
	removed, when I have an XSLT style sheet that does the same as the
	current code generation does.


2002-08-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Added support for stored procedure. Use the new Xplain keyword
	procedure to embed statements in a stored procedure. Only the get
	statement is currently supported. See manual for details.

	* DB2 inserts where instance identity is specified, should now
	work correctly. Previously it was possible to insert identities,
	but they probably would conflict with DB/2 generated values sooner
	or later. It seems you need Fixpack 2 for this to work.


2002-08-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* DB2 outputs now a clob data type instead of a long varchar as
	that more matches what is meant by a T data type. The long varchar
	supported just 32700, now up to 1MB is supported, and can easily
	be extended. How to do this portably, I don't know yet. Perhaps
	specify a size after the T data type?

	* DB2 has now insert, update and delete stored procedure output.


2002-08-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* DB2 output now uses @ as command separator, else stored
	procedure support could not be implemented. I didn't have the
	db2udp function (whatever that is), so to active stored procedure
	support I had to do this in my db2inst/sqllib/profile directory:

	    ln -s /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/function/db2udp .

	* PostgreSQL now outputs serial8 if the primary key is longer as 9
	digits. Not all versions of PostgreSQL covered by -postgres
	support this, perhaps should add a new switch.


2002-08-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added option -ecli, writes Eiffel classes specific for ecli to a
	mw subdirectory. This mw subdirectory must exist. This feature is
	unstable, not ready for general use.

	* At start of script now outputs which SQL dialect it targets.

	* Moved to ChangeLog for history, file History is obsolete now.
